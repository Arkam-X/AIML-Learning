# 🧠 My AIML Journey �

Welcome to **AIML Learning** — my personal space where I explore, build, and experiment with **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.  
This repository documents my complete journey across both domains — from foundational ML algorithms to advanced LLM-powered AI systems.

Every project here represents a concept I learned, implemented, and understood deeply.  
This isn’t just a code repository — it’s a growing timeline of my **AIML evolution**, showcasing real projects, experiments, and hands-on implementations across both AI and ML.
